            <h1>Introduction to Chess</h1>
            <p>Chess is a two-player game of strategy that has been played for over a thousand years.<br> It is widely considered to be one of the oldest and most popular games in the world, and has evolved into<br> a sport and even an art form. Chess is played on a square board with 64 squares, arranged in an 8x8 grid.<br> The board is usually black and white, with the squares alternating between these two colors. Each player <br> starts with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns.</p>
